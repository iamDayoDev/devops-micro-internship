# Week 1 – Success Mindset
This week is not motivation homework.
This is you building my Mindset OS — the system you will use for the next 5 months (and beyond) to become a high performer in your career and life.
Below are all the assignments, explanations, screenshots, and results I completed as part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI Cohort).

## Task 1: What is something you believe to be true that most people around you would disagree with?

### My Answer:
There might be people who disagree with this belief, or it might be a flawed belief on my part. But I truly believe that some of our life choices are influenced by the environment we live or grow up in. I have had instances where my environment played a significant part in some of the decisions and life choices that have shaped my life to this point. 

## Task 2: What are the top 3 objective truths you discovered through experimentation and results?

### My Answer:
Truth #1: Success comes through hard work and not by luck, as people perceive it to be.
Evidence from my life: Whenever I read for exams with strong determination, I have never failed an exam. 


Truth #2: Happiness is free, and we are responsible for our happiness. 
Evidence from my life: Lately, I’ve not really been happy with my current situation, but the times I've tried to be intentional about being happy, I have felt extreme happiness.

Truth #3: Health is wealth, which is a truth that resonates with me.
Evidence from my life: I’m on routine medications, and anytime I’m consistent with them, I always feel much more alive, and it helps my productivity.

## Task 3: What does your 2.0 version look like?
I answered this question with a blog post;

## Task 4: Have you ever cut corners (unethical / dishonest / shortcut behavior — not necessarily illegal)? If yes, how did it make you feel?

My answer for this question is very personal, so I wrote it in my private journal.

9. The Now Habit By Neil Fiore 
10. Unleash The Power of Storytelling: Win Hearts, Change Minds, Get Results By Rob Biesenbach

## Task 6: What are the things you will measure regularly in your life and career?
-   Track how much I spend and Invest (Amount)
-   Track the amount of sleep I have daily. (Hours)
-   Number of Weekly Projects
-   Keep track of the articles I write weekly.
-   Monitor my productivity through Projects and articles written.

## Task 7: Brain dump + 5-month system plan
Step 1: I answered this question with a private journal.

Step 2: My 5-month routine + focus blocks (write this)
I created a simple plan I can realistically follow for the next 5 months.

### Weekly routine: (your weekly structure)
i. Mon - Thur for deep research and working on DMI assignments.
ii. Do my morning Devotion everyday. 6:30 am. 7:30 am 
iii. Read at least 1 chapter of my recommended book for the week.
### Focus blocks:
i. I will start work on my DMI assignments on Mondays - Thursdays, 9 am daily. 
ii. Depending on the amount I have to cover for the week. But I’ll have a minimum of 3 sessions to work on my DMI assignments per week.
#### Distraction rules:
i. Put my phone on focus and put it away for the duration of my learning, reading or working on assignments.
ii. Complete my other activities before starting my work to avoid disruption in concentration.
